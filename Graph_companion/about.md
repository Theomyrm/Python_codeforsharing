Hi!, this is one of my latest lighting apps made in python. The purpose of it is simple; use the generic format with an AI such as chatGPT 
as a guide to it to draw to you graphs acordingly to your conversation; I left inside a pair of examples of a data engineering project.
The point of it is to have a contextualizated AI that can make it's point with the complexity of a graph.
